  We're all about Electric Unicyling in Edmonton.<br />
  We meet once a week or two to chat about things and work on skills.<br />
  We do demos for anyone new who is interested in learning and usually finish up with a short trip somewhere around the city on our wheels.<br />
  Check out some of our trips below.
